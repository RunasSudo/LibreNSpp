Thank you for contributing to LibreNS++!

Compiling
=========
The `LibreNSpp.user.js` file in the base directory is updated by running `build.sh` from the `src` folder.
This requires copies of `m4` and `expand`.
`m4` and `expand` are provided by GNU on Linux systems.
On Windows, [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) will provide them.
